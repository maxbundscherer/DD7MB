## About Me

Hello everyone,

I am happy to be a radio amateur now (12/12/2023)! I am located in Nuremberg (QTH JN59NK).

I use an ALINCO DJ-MD-5X-EG handheld radio for DMR & FM and APRS. Thankfully I am also allowed to use the club station [DF0OHM](https://www.qrz.com/db/DF0OHM) - thanks to [DL1NAW](https://www.qrz.com/db/DL1NAW).

I am interested in many modes, especially PSK31, FT8, satellite communication, RTTY, SSTV, APT, and further developments of these modes.

You can also visit my [A-SDR / Independer](https://a-sdr.org) website.

When I'm active, I usually listen on the local FM analogue and DMR repeaters (Brandmeister-Network - Talkgroups 26284, 26391).

I am always happy to receive a DMR SMS.

## A-SDR and Antennas

Before my amateur radio days, I focussed on receiving radio signals via SDR. That's why I still like to use my Nooelec SDR sticks for reception today. I use a MoonRaker groundplane antenna and an Active MLA-30 loop antenna with a HF upconverter (Ham It Up). Sometimes I also use a receiver amplifier, also from MoonRaker. Furthermore I use a HackRF with the ANT500 antenna.

Read more about this on my [A-SDR / Independer](https://a-sdr.org) website.
