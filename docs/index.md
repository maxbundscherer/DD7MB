## About Me

Hello everyone,

I am happy to be a radio amateur now (12/12/2023)! I am located in Nuremberg (QTH JN59NK) and I am a member of DARC (DOK B11). I prefer **QSL via Bureau** - alternatively also via eQSL and QRZ.

I am mainly active using the following callsigns and radios:

* [DF0OHM](https://www.qrz.com/db/DF0OHM) - *HF/VHF/UHF* - Club Station Of Technische Hochschule Nuernberg Georg Simon Ohm (Kenwood TS-2000X or Icom IC-7300 with 5LPDA8 and T2FD Antenna)
* [DD7MB](https://www.qrz.com/db/DD7MB) - *HF* - Personal callsign (Icom IC-7300 with Difona HF-P1 Antenna)
* [DD7MB/P](https://www.qrz.com/db/DD7MB) - *VHF/UHF* - Portable operation (Alinco DJ-MD-5X-EG)

I am interested in many modes, especially PSK31, Olivia, CW/Morse, satellite communication, Meteor Scatter, RTTY, FT8, JS8, SSTV and further developments of these modes.

You can also visit my [A-SDR / Independer](https://a-sdr.org) website.

## Satellite Ground Station (SatNOGS)

I operate [satellite ground stations](https://network.satnogs.org/users/dd7mb/) at DF0OHM in the SatNOGS network.

All stations use RTL-SDR (Nooelec v5) receivers. A Turnstile antenna (TA-1) and a VHF-Cross-Yagi with tracking are used for VHF. For UHF, a UHF-Cross-Yagi is also used with tracking.

## DF0OHM in 2024

I am currently mainly active on HF with [DF0OHM](https://www.qrz.com/db/DF0OHM).

I have published a small report for this station for the year 2024. You can find it [here](df0ohm-2024.md).

## A-SDR and Antennas

Before my amateur radio days, I focussed on receiving radio signals via SDR. That's why I still like to use my Nooelec SDR sticks for reception today.

I use a MoonRaker groundplane antenna and an Active MLA-30 loop antenna with a HF upconverter (Ham It Up). Sometimes I also use a receiver amplifier, also from MoonRaker. Furthermore I use a HackRF with the ANT500 antenna.

Read more about this on my [A-SDR / Independer](https://a-sdr.org) website.

## APRS

I regularly send APRS messages via my LoRa iGate [DD7MB (aprs.fi)](https://aprs.fi/info/DD7MB). I also use it to forward messages to the APRS-IS.

I use [DD7MB-9 (aprs.fi)](https://aprs.fi/info/DD7MB-9) when I'm travelling on foot or by car.

## HF Propagation

For propagation conditions, especially for QTH Germany, I recommend the [weather and propagation forecast by fading.de](https://www.fading.de/funkwetter/das-aktuelle-funkwetter) and the [DX propagation map by DR2W](https://dr2w.de/dx-propagation/).

I also recommend the [solar-terrestrial data by hamqsl.com](https://www.hamqsl.com/solar.html):

[VOACAP](https://www.voacap.com/11m/index.html) and [KC2G](https://prop.kc2g.com/) can also be useful to estimate propagation conditions.
